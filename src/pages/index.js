                    Hi there! Thank you for visiting my site. I am Arjun, a high school student at UWCSEA in Singapore. I am a curious 
                    person and I like to build things using new technology that may ultimately help people.<br/><br/>

                    Some of the things I have been up to recently include co-founding the Smartbin â€“ a sustainable recycling solution. 
                    We were so excited when the project got featured in the Google Blog! I am currently working on moving the project 
                    forward, and introducing it to the real world.<br/><br/>

                    I loved my time working with the amazing folks at the innovation lab at Palo IT, where I did my internship. I got 
                    the opportunity to work on a live greenhouse management system in Cambodia. We built a technology to use AI to manage 
                    a large number of greenhouses automatically. We think this could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and be used
                    for farming in remote areas and who knows - even on another planet?<br/><br/>

                    I enjoy public speaking, writing, learning new languages and doing what I can to help people and the environment. As 
                    the leader of my computer science club, I teach a class of 20 + G9-12 students in programming fundamentals in Java. My 
                    love for languages(Hindi, Spanish and Japanese so far) inspired me to create a self learning app called the Kanji 
                    trainer.<br/><br/>

                    Thank you or reading and feel free to drop me a line at hi @arjuntaneja.com
