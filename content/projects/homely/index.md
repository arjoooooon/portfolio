description: A web application that connects customers with vendors. During the coronavirus, consumers often go out to shop only to realize that the item they desire is out of stock.

###Origins

During the Covid-19 lockdown, My friends and I began to notice the effects of broken global supply chains in our communities. Oftentimes, we would go out to stores to buy items, and we would find that they would be out of stock. This does not bode well during a pandemic, as exiting the house multiple times to find an item increases the potential for disease transmission within our communities. That's why, in an online Hackathon named "TitanHacks", we created Homely.

###Purpose

Homely offers a unique solution to the problem with physical shopping and stock shortage. The first thing it does is that it allows consumers to see in which shops a particular item is available so that they don't need to make multiple trips to find it. It can also connect consumers to small businesses, which were impacted the most by the pandemic. Encouraging this kind of expenditure could help support communities and maintin employment.
