After all, surely a means of creative expression cannot produce knowledge so concrete as can the Natural Sciences or Mathematics. In fact, the notion that there is little knowledge to be gained from art has been furthered by many intellectuals in the recent past. The Wildean perspective, for example, is that art ought to be made for the sake of artistry, that “art need not express anything but itself”. Under this artistic paradigm, the conclusion that knowledge cannot be ascertained from The Arts follows quite naturally. Indeed, Oscar Wilde himself stated in his preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray that “All art is quite useless”.</p>\n<p>While such a claim may be comforting to students making metaphysical speculations on the nature of art, the line of thought (regrettably) falls apart under closer scrutiny. After all, oftentimes art is used as a medium of communicating some set of moral, or religious truths. For example, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, painted by Michaelangelo in the midst of the Renaissance, most definitely appeals to conventional aesthetic values. However, looking at the art solely through this lens is an exercise in ignorance. Clearly, Michelangelo’s work conveys a wealth of religious knowledge. As shown, a simple example can prove that art is not meaningless.

That is to say, can knowledge still be derived from an artwork without some sort of outside context? The reason why such a question is contentious is because there is a fundamental divide between an artist’s vision, and a person’s interpretation of an artwork. The artist behind a pioneering work of musical impressionism may believe his work to be incredibly emotionally profound. Though a person listening to the same piece may only experience a dense cacophony of formless sounds. Furthermore, there is the problem of interpretation. The mere fact that different people can extract different, even conflicting meanings from the same work of art makes it such that art can hardly be called robust – let alone replicable. Paradoxically, the best art is usually that which evokes the largest variety of responses within an audience.

This is clearly absurd. By giving more weight to informed criticism of artwork, we can more accurately identify the meaning within art.
